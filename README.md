# CS146 Project 3 - Maze

Maze project that creates a perfect maze and then solves it using Depth-first search, `DFS` and Breadth-first search, `BFS` techniques.

### How to Run the Code
Run the `GraphTest.java` file by going to:
/src/sjsu/narula/cs146/project3/GraphTest.java

Code for the `Graph` and `Vertex` class is located in `project3` package.

### Running Tests
The `GraphTest.java` class logs the following:
* perfect graph
* BFS with steps
* BFS with hash symbol
* DFS with steps
* DFS with hash symbol
